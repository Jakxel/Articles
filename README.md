Articles

This repository contains a collection of technical and academic articles
written in **LaTeX**, focused on **tech industry basics**, **Computer Science
fundamentals**, **software engineering**, and **real-world applications**.

The main goal of this repository is to act as a long-term knowledge base for
learning and reference. The content is written with patience, clarity, and
practical intuition in mind — especially for people who like to learn things
*slowly*, *properly*, and without unnecessary pain.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by topic and learning progression, from core
concepts to advanced and real-world material:

- **01-Core-CS-Fundamentals**  
  The foundations of Computer Science: mathematics, algorithms, data
  structures, operating systems, networking, databases, and theoretical
  concepts that everyone pretends to know but rarely revisits.

- **02-Software-Engineering**  
  Practical and theoretical software engineering topics such as collaboration,
  quality assurance, requirements analysis, software architecture, and
  development methodologies.

- **03-System-Design**  
  Articles focused on designing scalable, reliable, and maintainable systems,
  with an emphasis on trade-offs and real engineering decisions.

- **04-Advanced-Topics**  
  Deeper and more specialized topics for when curiosity wins and you decide
  to go further down the rabbit hole.

- **05-Real-World-Applications**  
  Practical articles and case studies based on real systems, tools, and
  software problems.

Additional folders contain applied projects and technical explorations,
such as **LogAnalyzer**, **React-StartKit**, and **Web Development**.

## Format & Tooling

- All articles are written in **LaTeX**
- Compiled using `pdflatex`
- Source files are version-controlled for reproducibility
- Generated build artifacts are excluded via `.gitignore`
- Focus on clean sources, not noisy build files

## Purpose

This repository exists for:
- Personal learning and long-term knowledge consolidation
- Explaining complex topics in a clear, approachable way
- Building a structured technical reference over time
- Supporting future real-world software projects and ideas

## Status

This is an **active and evolving repository**.  
Content will be added, refined, rewritten, and improved over time — slowly,
carefully, and without rushing (because rushing is overrated).
