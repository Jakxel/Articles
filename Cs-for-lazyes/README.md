# CS for Lazys

Welcome to **CS for Lazys** — a gentle, patient, and slightly bizarre corner of
Computer Science.

This section is designed for people who want to understand **core CS concepts**
without rushing, without buzzword overload, and without pretending that
everything is “obvious”.

If you’ve ever thought:
> “I *kind of* understand this… but not really.  
> Or why didn’t I see this explained like this in college?”

You’re in the right place.

## What is CS for Lazys?

**CS for Lazys** is a collection of articles that explain fundamental Computer
Science topics in a **friendly, practical, and intuitive way**.

The goal is not speed.  
The goal is understanding.

The focus is on:
- Clear explanations  
- Simple mental models  
- Practical intuition  
- Understanding *why* things work the way they do  

No unnecessary math flexing.  
No “just trust me” explanations.  
No shame in going back to basics.

## Topics Covered

This section covers the **core foundations of Computer Science**, including:

- **Mathematics for CS**  
  Just enough math to understand what’s happening under the hood.

- **Algorithms & Data Structures**  
  Not just how they work, but *why* they exist.

- **Programming Paradigms**  
  Different ways of thinking about code and problem solving.

- **Computer Architecture**  
  What your computer is actually doing when your code runs.

- **Operating Systems**  
  Processes, memory, scheduling, and all the invisible magic.

- **Theory of Computation**  
  The limits of what computers can (and cannot) do.

- **Networking & Communication**  
  How computers talk to each other (and why it sometimes fails).

- **Databases**  
  Data storage, access patterns, and design fundamentals.

## Writing Style

Articles in this section are:
- Written in **plain and friendly language**
- Structured step by step
- Heavy on intuition and examples
- Light on unnecessary formalism
- Designed to be read without stress

Think of it as:
> “Explaining Computer Science to your past self — patiently.”

## Format & Tooling

- Articles are written in **LaTeX**
- Compiled using `pdflatex`
- Source-focused and reproducible
- Clean structure, minimal noise

## Philosophy

Learning Computer Science doesn’t have to be painful.

You are allowed to:
- Take your time
- Re-read concepts
- Ask “basic” questions (to yourself, out loud, or to an AI)
- Learn at your own pace

Being lazy doesn’t mean being careless.  
It means being **efficient with effort**.

## Status

This section is **actively growing**.  
Articles will be added, refined, and occasionally rewritten as understanding
deepens — because learning is iterative.

Take a seat. Grab a coffee.  
Let’s make Computer Science a little less scary.
